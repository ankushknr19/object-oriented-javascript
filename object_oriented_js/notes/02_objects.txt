object in js is collection of key value pairs.


1. creating objects
2. factories and constructors 
3. primitives and reference types 
4. working with properties 
5. private properties 
6. getters and setters 



1. creating objects:


using {} -> object leteral syntax

const circle = {
    radius: 1,
    location: {
        x: 1,
        y: 1
    },
    draw: function() {
        console.log('draw')
    }
}

radius and location are properties - used to hold some values.
draw is method - define some logic.

access by using dot. -> circle.draw()


object literal syntax is not a good method to create an object
if the object has at least one method (or behaviour).


2. facrtories and constructors

factory function has return
constructor function has this keyword and needs 'new' to create object.
'new' refers to window in browser and global in node

2.1 Constructor property

Every object in js has constructor property that 
references to the function that was used to create that object.
JS uses this constructor function internally. 

In js, functions are object.



3. Primitives and referenc types

primitives = number, string, boolean, symbol, undefined, null
reference types = object, function, array

primitives are copied by their value,
Objects are copied by their reference.
